### üèóÔ∏è **Fragile Base Class Problem**

The **Fragile Base Class Problem** occurs when **changes made to a base (parent) class unintentionally break the behavior of derived (child) classes**. This happens because child classes depend heavily on the internal implementation details of the parent class, making the system fragile and error-prone.

---

### üö® **Why It Happens:**

1. **Tight Coupling:**  
   Inheritance creates a strong dependency between the parent and child classes.
2. **Hidden Dependencies:**  
   Child classes might rely on behaviors that aren't explicitly designed for extension, like the internal state or private methods.

3. **Violation of Encapsulation:**  
   Changes in the parent‚Äôs internal logic can affect the derived class even if the external interface remains unchanged.

### ‚ö° **Example of the Fragile Base Class Problem**

#### ‚ùå **Initial Working Code:**

```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value

class Derived(Base):
    def display(self):
        print("Value from Base:", self.get_value())

# Works perfectly
obj = Derived()
obj.display()  # Output: Value from Base: 42
```

- **Here:** The `Derived` class depends on `get_value()` from the `Base` class, which works fine.

---

#### üö© **Problem After Modifying the Base Class:**

```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        # Changed the internal implementation
        self._value = "forty-two"  # Changed from int to string

    def get_value(self):
        return self._value * 2  # New behavior: duplicate the string

class Derived(Base):
    def display(self):
        # Expects an integer, but now gets a string
        print("Double Value:", self.get_value() + 10)  # üö® Error here

obj = Derived()
obj.display()
```

#### ‚ùó **Output:**

```
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

---

### üîç **What Went Wrong?**

- **Hidden Dependency:** `Derived` assumed `get_value()` would return an integer, but `Base` changed it to a string without any warning.
- **Tight Coupling:** `Derived` was tightly coupled to the internal behavior of `Base`.
- **Result:** A simple change in `Base` broke the `Derived` class without any changes to the derived code.

### ‚úÖ **How to Avoid the Fragile Base Class Problem**

1. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**

   - Use **composition** to reduce tight coupling.
   - This way, changes to a component don‚Äôt break dependent classes.

2. **Program to Interfaces (or Abstract Classes)**

   - Rely on well-defined contracts instead of concrete implementations.
   - This enforces a clear boundary for behavior.

3. **Minimize Inheritance Depth**

   - Deep hierarchies increase fragility.
   - Prefer **shallow inheritance trees**.

4. **Use Final Classes or Methods (Where Applicable)**

   - In languages like Java/C++, mark classes or methods as `final` to prevent unintended inheritance.

5. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Ensure that derived classes can substitute the base class without altering the correctness of the program.
